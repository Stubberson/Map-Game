# Mag Guessing Game
A school project for a programming course.

## Description of the project
The game has two modes, a game mode where the player can guess a European country from a map highlighted by the country’s flag, and an interactive map which gives the player information about a country when the country is selected. 

Additional hints (e.g. capital and population number) about the country are given if the player guesses the country wrong. My project’s uniqueness comes from experimenting with audio. The national anthem is played for the player in the interactive map.

## File and directory structure
There are three directories in my project: .idea, code, and document. `.idea` can be ignored. `code` includes all the code for the program as well as the files needed to run the code. The module names should speak for themselves. `document` directory includes the plan, documentation, and demo for the program/project.

## User instructions
Execute the program from the "main.py" module in the "code" directory. It is intuitive to go from there.

The program doesn't need any external libraries.
