# Y2_2024_47804 – Mag Guessing Game

## Checkpoint 3 / Checkpoint 6

## Current properties
Checkpoint 3: Main navigation of the game works kinda ok. Player can switch from the welcoming window to the main game mode and go to the statistics window and back, as well. The main game mode is currently very bare, but that I will work on next week.

Checkpoint 6: Navigation is working. Main game mode works so that it can be played. Interactive map is in a good state. Main game mode will be worked on and some quality-of-life improvements will be added.

## Description of the project
The basic interface of the game would have an interactive map which gives the player information
about a country when the country is selected. There would be a few game modes to make the
application more intriguing: a guessing game where the player tries to guess a country based on
the country’s borders, and another one where the player guesses the country based on the
country’s flag. Additional hints (e.g. capital and population number) about the country will be given
if the player guesses the country wrong.
